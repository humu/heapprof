<p>Heap profiles think about memory in terms of stack traces: where in the execution flow the code was
when a piece of memory was allocated or freed. In heapprof, stack traces are sequences of (file
name, line number) pairs; these are the values that were correct while the code was running.
(heapprof also has “dressed” stack traces which include the text of that line of code; these are
extracted at analysis time, so they only make sense if the code hasn’t changed)</p>
<p>Because a single line of code could be reached through many paths, a point in execution is described
by its full stack trace. This still isn’t fully unique (the same code path is often run through many
times with different data!) but is a fairly good identifier.</p>
<p>heapprof also focuses on the lines of code at which a particular piece of memory was <em>allocated</em>. It
keeps track of when the memory was freed, but not where.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Some possible future improvements would be to allow users to annotate stack traces (this requires
a change to Python), or to have heapprof also track where in the code memory was freed. The second
would have serious performance implications, so would need a clear use case to justify.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You can think of the event log (the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.hpd</span></code> file) as a sequence of events that look like (timestamp,
stack trace ID, amount of memory allocated or freed). The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.hpm</span></code> file maps stack trace ID’s to
actual stack traces. The event digest (the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.hpc</span></code> file) is a sequence of snapshots, each of which is
a dict from trace ID to the amount of memory allocated there which hasn’t yet been freed.</p>
<p>To understand where your memory is going, there are a few things you often want to look at:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Is memory suddenly being allocated at one point in the program, or is it gradually creeping up?</p></li>
<li><p>If memory usage is really high at some point in time, what’s using all that memory? If it’s
growing, where did the growth come from?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>heapprof has three built-in visualization tools to help with this: <a class="reference external" href="#time-plots">time plots</a>, <a class="reference external" href="#flow-graphs">flow
graphs</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="#flame-graphs">flame graphs</a>. If you need to dig deeper, the
<a class="reference external" href="#api-access-to-data">API’s</a> let you look at the numbers directly.</p>
<div class="section" id="time-plots">
<h2>Time Plots<a class="headerlink" href="#time-plots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Time plots let you view memory changes over time. The simplest way to view one is</p>

</div>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pyplot</span></code> method requires <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matplotlib</span></code>. See the
<a class="reference external" href="using_heapprof.md#installation-and-system-requirements">installation instructions</a> for how to
install it if you don’t already have it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The result looks something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="A sample time plot" src="_images/timeplot.png" />A sample time plot</p>
<p>The X-axis is time in seconds, and the Y-axis is memory in bytes. You can see in this image (and by
either looking at the returned <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">heapprof.Reader.TimePlot</span></code> object or using the pyplot UI) that memory
usage spiked radically at 3,240 seconds, and drops back down at 5,640 seconds. (These numbers are
multiples of 60 because the digest was created with a time resolution of 60 seconds, which is
clearly fine for a job lasting over 12 hours!)</p>
<p>This plot is often your first place to start analyzing, since it lets you quickly spot times at
which you want to zoom in more deeply. Later on, you might discover a few lines of code which keep
showing up as possible culprits (we’ll see how to do that with flow and flame graphs); if you pass
those to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">timePlot</span></code>, you can see how they compare.</p>

<p>This yields a plot like this:</p>
<p><img alt="A split time plot" src="_images/split_time_plot.png" />A time plot showing individual lines of code</p>
<p>The top row is the same as the original time plot, showing total memory usage over time. The second
row shows the number of bytes used by each of the lines of code you selected; the bottom row shows
the fraction of all bytes used by each of the lines of code. As you can tell from the legend, the
line labeled <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bt_read</span></code> is steadily about 40% of all memory usage, including during the spike, while
the line marked <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">split_keys</span></code> seems to have a more pronounced jump, both in total and fractional
usage.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>These are plots from real software! This was a data pipeline reading large volumes from storage.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bt_read</span></code> is the line in the client library that copies data from the network response into Python
objects; <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">split_keys</span></code> is the line that’s separating keys from wire data, while <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make_proto</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">yield_cells</span></code> were separating out the values. This says that most of the memory is steadily in the
buffers coming from the outside world, but during the spike, there are a lot more keys running
around. As with any debugging, you’ll need intimate knowledge of what your code is logically
<em>doing</em> at any step to find the issue; heapprof just points you in the right direction.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flow-graphs">
<h2>Flow Graphs<a class="headerlink" href="#flow-graphs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Flow graphs are directed graphs, where each line of code is represented by a node, and each function
call is represented by an edge. The “local usage” of a node is how much memory is allocated by
that line of code; the “cumulative usage” of a node is how much memory is allocated by that line,
and everything it calls. The usage of an edge is how much memory was allocated by code paths that
went along that edge. Flow graphs can show memory usage at one or more timestamps on a single view.
From a distance, they look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="A zoomed-out flow graph" src="_images/distant_flow_graph.png" />A flow graph zoomed out</p>
<p>From close up, they look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="A zoomed-in flow graph" src="_images/zoomed_flow_graph.png" />A flow graph up close</p>
<p>Each box has three parts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The sequence of lines of code. If each call to a single line leads to another single line, and no
significant memory is being allocated by the individual lines, they’re all grouped together in a
single box; any memory that’s actually being allocated is (by definition) being allocated by the
bottommost line.</p></li>
<li><p>The colored boxes at the bottom show memory counts. Each box has the form “local usage /
cumulative usage = percent”. Local usage is the amount of memory allocated by that bottommost
line of code directly. Cumulative usage is the amount of memory allocated by that line, plus by
any functions called by that line. Percentage is simply the cumulative usage as a percent of
total memory usage in the program. Each box is color-coded by percentage, moving from blue
(small usage) to red (high usage). When there are multiple boxes, this corresponds to multiple
timestamps.</p></li>
<li><p>The edges coming out of a box indicate different lines of code which could come after this line
and are the next places where memory is allocated. The number by the edge is the amount of
memory allocated along this path; if there are multiple numbers, they correspond to multiple
timestamps.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So in the zoomed-in diagram, we see that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bigtable/row_data.py:483</span></code> was allocating 15.1kB of memory.
(This is a line in a client library which calls a function that processes a single chunk of data
from the network) After reaching that line, the next line of code which allocates memory is either
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">row_data.py:510</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">row_data.py:501</span></code>, which are two different branches of the next function
called, that handle different possible contents of that data chunk. We see that at timestamp 1, a
total of 182.9MB was being allocated in the first path, and 444.1MB in the second; by timestamp 2,
the first one jumped to 542.8MB, while the second jumped only to 579.7MB. Looking at the next boxes,
we see that the first box jumped from light blue to dark blue, meaning that the jump to 542.8MB also
meant it now took up a much larger fraction of system memory; the second box went from purple to
dark blue, meaning that although it took up more bytes, it took up a smaller fraction of total
usage. That is, in the transition between these two timestamps, suddenly a lot more memory was being
taken up by the code path that goes through <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">row_data.py:510</span></code>.</p>
<p>A flow graph for a single timestamp can be created with</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">heapprof</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;filebase&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A flow graph comparing multiple timestamps can be created with</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">r</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">compareFlowGraphs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;flow-3800-vs-4500.dot&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3800</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4500</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Dot files can be viewed with <a class="reference external" href="https://graphviz.org">graphviz</a>; on an OS X or UNIX system, for
example, you would do this with</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">dot</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Tpdf</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">o</span> <span class="n">flow</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">3800</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">vs</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">4500.</span><span class="n">pdf</span> <span class="n">flow</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">3800</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">vs</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">4500.</span><span class="n">dot</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">writeDotFile</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">compareFlowGraphs</span></code> methods have various options about how the graph will be
rendered – which lines and edges to suppress as “too small to matter,” and whether the size of
nodes should be scaled based on their local usage. Local usage scaling has its pros and cons: it
lets you very quickly see where memory is being allocated, but it draws your eye to the actual line
where the allocation happens, rather than to the longer code path leading there, which is
highlighted by colors. Which setting is most useful will vary as you debug a particular situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flame-graphs">
<h2>Flame Graphs<a class="headerlink" href="#flame-graphs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Flame graphs were originally designed to view CPU usage, but can also be used to analyze memory.
heapprof’s preferred tool to view flame graphs is <a class="reference external" href="https://speedscope.app">speedscope</a>. These are
interactive objects viewed in a browser; a typical flame graph looks like this.</p>
<p><img alt="_images/flame_graph.png" src="_images/flame_graph.png" />A flame graph zoomed out</p>
<p>In this diagram, each block represents a line of a stack trace, and its width represents the
cumulative amount of memory allocated by that line or by lines that follow it. A line is stacked up
on another line if it follows it. This means that wide blocks are where most of the memory is going,
so you can quickly see where the biggest memory use is. Unlike a flow graph, however, if a single
line of code can be reached through multiple paths, each of those paths will show up as a <em>separate</em>
block on the diagram; this means that if each path contributes a little, the fact that this line is
a central hub won’t be easily visible.</p>
<p>To help with that, from the flame graph you can flip to a “sandwich” view which looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="_images/flame_graph_sandwich.png" src="_images/flame_graph_sandwich.png" />Sandwich view of a flame graph</p>
<p>This is simply a list of the lines of code, with cumulative (“total”) and local (“self”) usage
listed.</p>
<p>Flame graphs and flow graphs show the same information overall, but they organize it in different
ways. Flame graphs are good for quickly seeing where the largest lumps are, but they obscure the
calling paths between lines of code; flow graphs show how memory flows through the system, but don’t
highlight all types of usage hotspot as vividly. You can (and should!) use both.</p>
<p>To create a flame graph at a single timestamp, run</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">heapprof</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;filebase&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">r</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">writeFlameGraph</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;flame-3800.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3800</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can then open this file either on the <a class="reference external" href="https://speedscope.app">speedscope website</a> or by
installing and running <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jlfwong/speedscope">speedscope</a> locally. In either case,
you should use the “left heavy” or “snapshot” views; the “time order” view is specific to CPU
profiling, and produces nonsense for these flame graphs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="api-access-to-data">
<h2>API Access to Data<a class="headerlink" href="#api-access-to-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you want to analyze the data in more depth than just visualizing it, you can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reader</span></code> API
to directly process the digested contents of a heap profile. Your most important tools for this are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reader.snapshotAt</span></code> returns a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Snapshot</span></code> of memory usage at a given relative time. Each snapshot
is simply a dict from trace index (a unique ID for each stack trace that shows up in the
profile) to the number of live bytes in memory allocated by that stack trace at that time.
A trace index of zero means “unknown trace;” this generally means that some subtle issue
prevented the profiler from collecting a trace.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reader.rawTrace</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reader.trace</span></code> go from a trace index to an actual stack trace. The
difference is that a raw trace contains only file names and line numbers, while a full trace
also fetches the actual line of code from the file, much like the traces shown in exception
tracebacks. Full traces can only be pulled if you have the same source files locally, and at the
same paths; thus they’re generally useful if you’re running the analysis on the same machine
where you collected the heap profile.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the visualization functions above are built on top of this API, so you can look at their
implementation for inspiration about ways to analyze the data.</p>
<p>There is also a low-level API which gives you access to the underlying “raw” heap traces, before
they’ve been digested into snapshots. The useful one of these is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Reader.hpd</span></code>. (There are also
low-level API’s to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hpm</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hpc</span></code> files, but they don’t provide any particular value above that
of the high-level API; they’re really implementation details) The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HPD</span></code> object is an iterable of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HPDEvent</span></code> objects, which are the raw items written to disk by the profiler. Each event contains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">timestamp</span></code>: The timestamp when the event occurred, in seconds since the epoch. (Note that this
is the absolute time, not the relative timestamp! You can get the global start time from the
high-level API)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">traceindex</span></code>: The trace index at which the corresponding piece of memory was allocated.
(Currently, heapprof does not store the trace index at which the memory was freed)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">size</span></code>: The number of bytes allocated or deallocated; this is positive for an allocation event,
negative for a free event.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scaleFactor</span></code>: Because heapprof is a sampling heap profiler, not all events are logged. This
number is a multiplicative scale factor which you should apply to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">size</span></code> to get an estimate of
the total number of bytes that were being allocated or freed during that time.</p></li>
